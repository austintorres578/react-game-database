### 🎮 Video Game Database (RAWG API)

A custom video game discovery platform I built for personal use, designed to search, explore, and rank games using live data from the **RAWG Video Game Database API**.  
Users can search by **game title**, **console**, or **genre**, and every game is fully interactive with its own dynamic detail page.

#### 🌟 Key Features
- 🔍 **Search Functionality** – Find games by name, console, or genre  
- 🏆 **Metacritic Sorting** – Games are automatically sorted by score so top-rated titles appear first  
- 🎨 **Dynamic Backgrounds** – Clicking a game updates the site background to match its theme  
- 💾 **Local Storage** – Saves the most recent search so users can continue where they left off  
- 🧭 **Browse All Games** – With no filters applied, view a full ranked library across all platforms and genres
